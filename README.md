Energy-efficient Medical Image Processing\\

Task 1 (Classification): Used 3D CNN with pruning to reduce model size and improve energy efficiency.\\

Task 2 (Segmentation): A U-Net architecture was used with early stopping and image resolution reduction.\\

Task 3 (Fetal Brain Segmentation): Attention U-Net with transfer learning and quantization for energy efficiency.\\

Replace placeholders (X_train, y_train, etc.) with actual datasets and use appropriate hyperparameters depending on the dataset provided.
